### Reinsertion
* Just keep it up.

### Images
* Still need to get the originals for:
	* BORNAS.UGD
		* I have an image but it has some numbers and bars in it. What does it look like raw?
	* END_2.UGD
		* How do I load this without it getting shaded?
	* FACE17-18.UGD, maybe
	* FACE19-21.UGD
		* Easy to load these, just put it as FACE00.UGD.

### Patcher
* Gotta call it Pachy98-CRW.exe.
