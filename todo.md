### Reinsertion
* So Mission 1 crashes right after control is restored after "Looks like there's still more above us."
	* With the original CR1.EXE in place:
		* Works.
	* With the CR1 assembly hacks restored to normal:
		* Still breaks.
	* So that means it's something to do with text or pointers in CR1.
